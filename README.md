A simple generator for kinda-sorta-complicated anki decks

Created mainly because I like the cloze style cards but they aren't handled well by existing tools

Quality of code is currently pretty low, but it definitely does what it says on the box.

usage: `python [Gendered|Non-Gendered].py {filename}.csv` creates output in the current directory
